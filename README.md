# GoogleInterview

--Author: Rayhan Hossain (Mukla.C)

In this GoogleInterview repo, I try to unite problem-solving techniques and algorithms which are frequently asked in coding interviews. From my personal interview experience in top tech companies, one should practice all the algorithms of this repo before sitting for a coding interview. I cannot guaranty that after practicing these you will get the job, but I believe, it 
will make the interview smoother.

Learn - Solve - And - Cheers!
